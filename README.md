# Rexp
A small parser for Symbolic Expressions in Rust.

I have been a bad Rustacean, and there is basically no documentation :/
There is a lot of redundant testing though :)

### Top Priorities
- [ ] Documentation Comments `///` for all the exported functions, and better explanation of internal details in regular comments.
- [ ] Implement traits for parsing from string and dumping to string.
- [ ] Check out BigInt crate to see if We can support 64 bit unsigned integers without adding more syntax to the SExpressions.
- [ ] Continue this list.
